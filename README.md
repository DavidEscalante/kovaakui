# CUSTION UI FOR KOVAAK 2.0
Live site: https://davidescalante.github.io/kovaakui/

This is a UI I created for personal tracking of my average performance on selected scenarios. Currently, it only supports six scenarios, but that's enough for me since I only use this UI for specific scenarios where I require more focus.

I created this UI before KovaaK included graphs to track performance, but even with the current KovaaK graphs, I can't control how the data is displayed.

- With this UI, I can set a goal which is displayed by a blue line.
- The UI also shows my current average performance, displayed by an orange line
- The world average, displayed by a red overlay. 

This way, I have a better view of where I currently stand, my overall performance during the entire training session, and how consistent my scores are. The KovaaK graph tends to zoom in on the latest scores, so even small deviations are visually overreacted compared to everything else. This UI helps me keep a better perception of my performance, whether it's good or bad.

The UI uses this Google Sheets as database:
